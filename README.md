## Reference

Dataviz using data from CO2 monitors to analyse CO2 levels. The data format is that output by the [indoorco2map.com](https://indoorco2map.com) project, a crowd-sourced dataset of CO2 levels non-residential buildings. The data is updated every 6 hours.

## Summary

This project presents a series of interactive dashboard pages to help analyse and understand the data collected on CO2 levels.  The page navigation control is at the centre-bottom, e.g. **< 1 of 4 >**. Click the centre of that control for a menu of the pages.

On every page, slicer controls allow the selection of a range of dates. There is a Play control immediately below to let you "play" through the selected dates in an animation.  There are also slicers to filter by the Day of the week and Hour of the day, Category, Location etc. In combination, many different analyses are possible.  Each visual element e.g. a point on a line chart can be selected, then it will act as a "cross-filter" to filter every other visual on that page.

On most pages, a detailed table at the bottom lists the individual CO2 readings within the scope of the current slicer settings. The table can be resorted by clicking any column header, and the **Focus mode** button (which appears at the top-right corner of the table on hover) will expand the table to fill the browser window.

The page: **Map and Scatter Chart** presents a map showing aggregated CO2 levels alongside a scatter chart showing a dot for every CO2 level measurement. The size of the map bubbles represent the number of CO2 readings at that Location. The color of the map bubbles are determined by the **CO2 Yellow Range** slicer (see below for details), for the median CO2 level recorded at that Location. See below for the description of the Scatter chart.

The page: **% Map and Scatter Chart** has a similar layout and function to the page described above: **Map and Scatter Chart**.  But instead of **CO2 levels** it presents the data as a **% Rebreathed** - what percentage of the air you are breathing has been passed through someones lungs.

The basis for that calculation is the paper [Risk of indoor airborne infection transmission estimated from carbon dioxide concentration - S. N. Rudnick, D. K. Milton](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0668.2003.00189.x).

David Elfstron (P.Eng, Energy management, measurement & verification) presented that paper's key calculation in an accessible way on [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1338327790874222592), which includes a Google Sheet implementation of the formula. I have tried to follow that method, including adding controls to adjust the **Outdoor Air CO2 ppm** and **Volume Fraction of CO2 added by breathing** from the suggested default values.

FWIW I am a big fan of this metric, as I think it is more concrete (visceral, even) for the general public to grasp, compared to "parts per million" of a gas that is always present to some degree.

The page: **Scatter Chart** presents a scatter chart showing a dot for every CO2 level measurement. When there are over 10,000 readings, an automatic sampling algorithm kicks in. It aims to mostly hide the points that overlap with others. The X-Axis is the time of day, expressed in decimal fractions of hours. The actual hour and minute shown is available in the tooltip for any point.  The Y Axis is the CO2 level. A **CO2 Yellow Range** slicer at the right controls which levels of CO2 are coloured Red-Yellow-Green.

The page: **Violin Plot** presents a [Violin Plot](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381947?tab=Overview) visual that elegantly aggregates data to show the shape of the data readings, combined with a Violin plot (combined with a Box plot) to show the median, mean and Inter-Quartile Range, and shape of the distribution. When there are over 30,000 readings, an automatic sampling algorithm kicks in using the Epanechnikov Kernel. The X-Axis is variable, driven by the **Legend Field** slicer selection. The Y Axis is the CO2 level. 

The page: **Line Chart** presents a Line chart visual that aggregates data by Time of day. Time here is expressed as a decimal value - the whole numbers are the hour of day (24-hour format) and the decimals are fractions of a day. This format gives the best results with the standard Power BI line chart visual. A tool-tip show the time in the conventional **hh:mm** format. The Legend is variable, driven by the **Legend Field** slicer selection. The Y Axis is the CO2 level. 

The page: **Map and Line Chart** presents a map showing aggregated CO2 levels alongside a line chart  that aggregates data by Time of day. See the descriptions above for **Map and Scatter Chart** for the map and **Line Chart**.

The page: **Small Multiples** presents a grid of Line charts that aggregates data by Time of day on the X-Axis. The split of data among the grid cells is variable, driven by the **Legend Field** slicer selection. The Y Axis is the CO2 level, standardised across all the grid cells. If more than 6 cells fill the grid, you can scroll down to view them all.

There is a hidden page: **Key Influencers** using the [Key Influencers visual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-influencers?tabs=powerbi-desktop), which is a very powerful no-code, machine learning analysis engine for understanding the relationships within the data. After every interactive filter you choose, the engine re-runs it's analysis to explore which factors are the Key Influencers for a variable - in this project the CO2 level. That visual is not supported by this publishing method, but you can install the free Power BI Desktop tool, download the .PBIX file from this project and open it to explore that page.
